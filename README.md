## CBT Nuggets Training for Amazon EC2 Image Builder

During this video skill at CBT Nuggets, we'll explore the Amazon EC2 Image Builder service.
You can use EC2 Image Builder inside of your own AWS account too automate the creation of operating system and container images.
Once an image is created, EC2 Image Builder will handle replicating that image to other AWS regions and accounts.
We'll be focusing our efforts on learning about EC2 Image Builder components, recipes, infrastructure configuration, distribution settings, and pipelines.
